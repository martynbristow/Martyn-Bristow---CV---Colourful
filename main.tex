As part of an agile development team I develop automated tests with the internal testing framework, and implement framework changes. I also setup and perform performing performance testing using Spirent, and producing analysis, including installing HP Gen8 servers. The work requires a good knowledge of Linux, Python and HTTP to debug issues and implement fixes. My teams is currently working to migrate servers to RHEL7, my role has been providing framework adoptions to support interacting with different operating systems through existing interfaces. 
Detailed achievements:
\begin{itemize}

  {\jobtitle{Analyst (placement)}\\
  I undertook a 12 month placement during my undergraduate degree with the DASA , part of the Ministry of Defence, in Portsmouth. My role was the production and development of the Royal Naval Situation report, a key statistics publication. The report was required monthly to tight deadlines and informed senior naval officers of personnel strengths. A key achievement during my placement was converting the product to use MySQL, where previously it had used SAS and increased stability. This enabled the MOD to cancel a 2k per annum software license.\\
